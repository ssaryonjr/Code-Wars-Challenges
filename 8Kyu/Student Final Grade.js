// Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

// This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

// 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
// 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
// 0, in other case

function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
    if(exam > 90 || projects > 10) return 100;
    if(exam > 75 & projects >= 5) return 90;
    if(exam > 50 & projects >= 2) return 75;
    return 0;
  }
